Clone the Flask Demo repository and create your own Flask app on Heroku that accepts a stock ticker input from the user and plots closing price data for the last month. The Quandle WIKI dataset provides this data for free, and you can use Python's Requests library along with simplejson to access it in Python via API. You can analyze the data using pandas and plot using Bokeh. By the end you should have some kind of interactive visualization viewable from the Internet.
